# Support

**Before you open a new issue, please ensure you have tried the following**: 

* Check the [ungoogled-chromium wiki](//ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-wiki) 
* Check the [Issue Tracker](//github.com/Eloston/ungoogled-chromium/issues) (make sure to search closed issues and use search filters, as applicable)
	* It will probably also be helpful to check [Issue Tracker of Bromite](//github.com/bromite/bromite/issues), which is another customized Android build
* If this is a problem, ensure it does *not* occur with regular Chromium or Google Chrome. If it does, then this is *not* a problem with ungoogled-chromium. Instead, please submit your feedback to the [Chromium bug tracker](//bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/list) or Google.

When opening a new issue, please make sure:

* The issue is not covered in a previous one
* One problem per issue, do not mix multiple topics in one issue
* If possible, report your system and Chromium version. Screenshots and logs are also helpful.
